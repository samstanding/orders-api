* Deployment instructions

This is an API to house order data from my React front-end. You can find that repo [here](https://github.com/samstanding/orders-client)

Fork or clone this over to your machine and install the dependecies `bundle install`.

Migrate the database `rails db:migrate` and seed statuses using `rails db:seed`.

Kick up the server on port 3001 `rails server -p 3001` and enjoy! 

* Ruby version
5.2.0
